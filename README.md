Assignment 2

Received Code:
1. Code Design
Code was designed very well for extension, proper implementation of factory and builder design patterns. SOLID principles were well implemented as well, each class has its own purpose and great cohesion between parent and child classes.
In my point of view developer of this program has extensive c++ syntax and library knowledge as he already implemented unique pointers and made use of util class even before discussed in lectures or tutorials.
2. Hindered Elements
Well it’s not really hindering part, but we can say some minor mistake in code implementation as instead of writing getters and setters of table and balls member variables those variables were declared as public and external classes had direct access to member variables.
3. Documentation
I didn’t receive external documentation about this code, so no idea about that but I found internal documentation is written for every method, very concise and easily understandable.
4. Code Implementation
As I mentioned in code design section, coding is done professionally and easy to extend with use of c++ 11 features and syntax which are even not discussed in lectures or tutorials.
